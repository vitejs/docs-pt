# Docs Translation Contributing Guide

This repo is a template for [Vite.js docs translation repositories](https://github.com/vitejs?q=docs).

## Creating a Translation Repo

1. Click [*Use this template*](https://github.com/tony19/vite-docs-template/generate) to scaffold a new translation repo in your personal GitHub.

2. This repo uses the [`ryo-cho` GitHub Action](https://github.com/vuejs-translations/ryu-cho) to keep it in sync with changes from [Vite's `docs`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/docs). It creates pull requests in this repo that cherry-pick the upstream changes to be translated ([example](https://github.com/tony19/vite-docs-template/pull/4)).

   Edit the following fields in [`/.github/workflows/ryo-cho.yml`](/.github/workflows/ryo-cho.yml):

    * `upstream-repo` - the Git URL of your translation repo (the URL should end with `.git`)
    * `upstream-repo-branch` - the target branch in your translation repo

   By default, `ryo-cho` is configured to use the `github-actions` bot, which works out of the box. However, you can use your own bot by configuring the following:

    * `username` - the GitHub username of a [machine user](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#machine-users) (e.g., `ci-bot`)
    * `email` - the email associated with the GitHub username above
    * `access-token` - a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) of the machine user (stored in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository), enabling `access-token: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET_TOKEN }}`)

3. Translate all user-visible strings (unless specified otherwise) in the following files to the target language:

    * [`/docs/.vitepress/config.ts`](/docs/.vitepress/config.ts) (the `og*`, `footer.*`, `text`, and `link` fields)
    * [`/docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeSponsors.vue`](/docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeSponsors.vue)
    * [`/docs/.vitepress/theme/composables/sponsor.ts`](https://github.com/tony19/vite-docs-template/blob/acea14e/docs/.vitepress/theme/composables/sponsor.ts#L44) (the `tier` fields)
    * [`/docs/_data/team.js`](/docs/_data/team.js) (the `title` and `desc` fields)
    * `/docs/**/*.md`
    * [`/CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * [`/README.md`](/README.md)
    * `/docs/images/*.svg`

   üí° *Tips:*

    * *Ping the [`#docs` channel](https://discord.com/channels/804011606160703521/855049073157341234) in [Discord](https://chat.vite.dev) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/categories/general) for others who can help with translations.*
    * *Submit pull requests in your repo for this work so that collaborators can proofread the translations.*

4. Create a [pull request in Vite's main repo](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pulls) to update the [locale links in `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/1e078ad1902ae980741d6920fc3a72d182fcf179/docs/.vitepress/config.ts#L55-L62), which would add the new language to the dropdown on the Vite homepage. Specifically, append to `localeLinks.items[]` an object with these keys:

    - `text` - the language name in its native spelling (e.g., `Espa√±ol`)
    - `link` - the URL to the target site, composed of the language's [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) as a subdomain of `https://vite.dev` (e.g., `https://es.vite.dev`)

    *Example for French:*

    ```js
    localeLinks: {
      items: [
        { text: 'Fran√ßaise', link: 'https://fr.vite.dev' },
      ]
    },
    ```

5. In the pull request's description, include the URL to your translation repo. Be prepared to [transfer the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository) to the [`vitejs` organization](https://github.com/vitejs) upon request by the [Vite team](https://github.com/orgs/vitejs/people). The transfer automatically adds you as a collaborator on the repo. The repo will be renamed to `docs-LANGUAGE_CODE` (e.g., `docs-fr`) after the transfer.
